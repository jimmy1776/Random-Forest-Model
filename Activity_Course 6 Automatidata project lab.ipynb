    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "Yes, this model correctly  identifies about 75% of the actual true positives in the test set, which is much better than a random guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that VendorID, predicted_fare, mean_duration, and mean_distance are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that VendorID is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "There are always new features that can be engineer, however, one hopes we were able to capture the essence of the data in the first round. \n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**  \n",
    "It would be useful to have data on a customer's past tipping behavior. This can probably be done by assigning a customer an ID and tracking their use of the cab service over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
